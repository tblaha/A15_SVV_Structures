Function names:
    --> first letter lower case, all other words upper case
    --> "myFunctionIsGreat"

Comments:
    --> small comments about a single line or very few lines of code go immediately above that line
    --> larger comments should precede different sections in the code and describe the overall procedure

Variables:
    --> underscors connect the words: "x_coords"
    --> underscores also indictate subscripts: "x_2"
    
Misc:
    --> no arbitrary loose numbers in formulas. If you need a constant: define it first in a separate variable and make a comment about what it means
